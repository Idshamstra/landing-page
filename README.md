# landing-page

I was really struggling to get my head around flexbox.. ALOT of googling was involved in the proccess, but after this i feel much more confident in my flexbox skills.
I know the page could still be better but for now i'm kinda happy with what it looks like.
I'll return to this project once I'm further along in the curriculum.
